Determined as I was towork in finance and investment after finishingmy studies, I discovered on time the potentialto be unleashed by the global agriculturalsector in order to face the challenges of theXXIst century: To feed not only a growing andincreasingly urban population with more andbetter products but also to achieve this aim bymaking the current industrial agriculturalpractices more sustainable. For these reasonsmy professional interests are focused onagribusiness in general and horticulture andagricultural commodities in particular.

All in all, I look for a balance betweenTHEORY and PRACTICE: Theoretical knowledge isneeded to understand reality and foresee thefuture while practical skills are necessary inorder to take advantage of that knowledge andoffer value to society. For this reason, whileI keep an eye on the global macroeconomictrends of the agricultural sector and businessopportunities, I am also actively engaged inthe sector working as a sales manager, andgrowing my own vegetable garden at the sametime, with my feet on the ground.n ...", "websites": []}, "skills": [{"endorsements": "3", "name": "Entrepreneurship"}, {"endorsements": "1", "name": "Agribusiness"}, {"endorsements": "1", "name": "Economic Analysis"}, {"endorsements": "1", "name": "Microsoft Office"}, {"endorsements": "1", "name": "English"}, {"endorsements": "1", "name": "German"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "Export"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "International Sales"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "Russian"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "French"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "Agricultural Marketing"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "New Markets Development"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "Living Abroad"}, {"endorsements": 0, "name": "Sales Organization"}]}
